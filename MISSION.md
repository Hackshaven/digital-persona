# Mission Statement

The **Digital Persona** project aims to provide a safe, open framework for representing personality data.
The research documents in the `docs/` directory outline existing standards for personal data and
psychological testing. We build upon those papers to ensure our tools and schemas promote ethical,
privacy‑respecting use of personality information.

## Guiding Principles

- **Do no harm** – Personality models and collected data must never be used to manipulate or exploit
  people. This project should enhance personal insight, not enable coercion.
- **User control** – Individuals own their data. Any systems built on this repository should clearly
  explain how personal information is stored and give users full control over how it is shared or deleted.
- **Security by design** – Protect data in transit and at rest. Adopt best practices for encryption,
  access control, and secure coding.
- **Open and distributed** – Favor open‑source components and decentralized architectures so that users
  can run tools locally or on trusted infrastructure.

All new features and pull requests must be checked against this mission statement to ensure
alignment with these principles.
