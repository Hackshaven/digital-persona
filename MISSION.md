# Digital Persona Project – Mission

## Why We Exist

Our mission is to empower individuals with a trusted, privacy-first digital persona — an AI twin that enhances memory, provides continuity, and offers personalized assistance. This technology is designed to keep each person in full control of their data and digital self. We aim to help people preserve their memories and knowledge, better understand themselves, and extend their presence. All of this is guided by core values and ethical principles.

## Promise and Potential

Digital personas hold immense promise. They can function as memory aids, enable digital continuity of one’s identity, and act as personalized assistants that truly understand you. By capturing your experiences and personality in software, a digital persona can help you remember more, learn and grow from your past, and even preserve your legacy for future generations.

## Principles and Safeguards

Equally, we recognize the serious risks of AI clones — such as identity theft, misuse, or psychological harm. That’s why our architecture is **privacy-first**, with informed consent and user control built in at every level: you decide what your digital twin knows and does, you can inspect, edit, or delete its data at any time, and no personal data leaves your device without your permission. We uphold transparency and a strict “do no harm” mandate to prevent manipulation or abuse. We also ensure the persona remains a supplement to you, not a replacement for your judgment or humanity.

## Leadership in Ethics

The Digital Persona Project is committed to leading by example. We continually update our practices to align with evolving ethical norms and legal frameworks, setting a high standard for developing and using personal AI clones responsibly. Our vision is a future where your closest AI is not only intelligent and helpful, but authentically you — empowering you without compromising your rights, privacy, or well-being.
